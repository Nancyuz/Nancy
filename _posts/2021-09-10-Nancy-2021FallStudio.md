###### Definition of home
Home is a plug-in system of different components. Plug-in structures can make good use of space to bring different elements together. As well, peopleâ€™s activities in space can be considered as a plug-in movement to a certain machine, like a table or a bed. Many homes can also be coalesced into a bigger house or a community to socialize in a plug-in system.
